        <div class="title">Not all foods emit equally.</div>
        In a comparison of greenhouse gas emissions per serving of 106 common food items, a few foods tower over the rest.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title"></div>
        Eating just one 3oz serving of sheep, beef, or crustacean (e.g. lobster, crab, shrimp) emits more greenhouse gases than driving 5 miles in an average car.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title"></div>
        Most other common food commodities fall near or below 1 mile driving in an average car.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">More greenhouse gas doesn't mean more calories.</div>
        Caloric value is not strongly correlated with the greenhouse gas emissions it takes to produce a given type of food.

        <div class="title">Let's take a look at the meats.</div>
        Meat tends to be worse on emissions than the other food groups, but some options are much better than others.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title"></div>
        For instance, choosing a serving of turkey instead of a serving of beef reduces emissions by almost 10X.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Consider protein alternatives.</div>
        There are lots of options for <b><font color="#ff7f00">protein alternatives</font></b> to <b><font color="#e41a1c">meat</font></b> that can provide the same nutritional value as meats, but have a much lower carbon footprint per serving.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title"></div>
        Beans and nuts provide some of the lowest carbon options for protein, but even switching to tofu or eggs will help reduce emissions compared to most meats.

        Now it's time to see how your diet stacks up. How do your emissions compare to the median in the US?
